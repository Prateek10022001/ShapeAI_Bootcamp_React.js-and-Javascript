      <h1>Javascript and React.js bootcamp</h1>
      <p>The bootcamp conducted by ShapeAI was awesome.
         We got to learn a lot from the basics, from our mentor Shaurya Sinha Sir.
        In this bootcamp we covered everything from scratch including Javascript and React.js, HTML. This bootcamp gave a great opportunity to learn a lot.
        Thankful to our mentees and ShapeAI.
